## Q:1 What is `Emmet`?

A: `Emmet` is the essential development toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to `type shortcuts` that helps you quickly create repetitive structures like lists, tables, or ordered elements with minimal typing. It is more like a shorthand that translates to multiple lines of HTML or a CSS attribute.
For example,

- `p\*10` would generate 10 p elements.
- `ol>li` would create an li inside the ol element.
- `div+p` would create a div element and a p element on the same level.
- `div+p>span` would result in a div and a p element on the same level with a span element as a child of p selector
- `(main>div)+div>ul>li\*5`

```javascript
        <main>
            <div></div>
        </main>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
```

- `p{This is a paragraph}` would create a p element with content "This is a paragraph".
- `p#news-section` to create a p element with the ID of news-section
- `p.news-espanol` p element with the class of news-espanol
- `button[type=submit]` create this button element: <button type="submit"></button>.
- `script:src` To link JavaScript

## Q:2 Difference between a `Library and Framework`?

A: A `library` is a collection of pre-written functions or modules that developers can use in their code, allowing them to perform specific tasks without starting from scratch.On the other hand, a `framework` is a pre-built architecture that dictates the overall structure and flow of an application. Developers use functions from a library by calling them in their code, while they build their code within the structure and guidelines provided by a framework. 

In the case of a library, developers control the flow of the code, whereas in a framework, the control flow is inverted. ReactJS is an example of a library, and ExpressJS is an example of a framework.

React is a library for building user interfaces, while Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides additional features and conventions for building React applications, such as routing, server-side rendering, and API handling.

## Q:3 What is `CDN`? Why do we use it?

A: A `content delivery network (CDN)` refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.

## Q:4 Why is `React known as React`?

A: `React` is named React because of its ability to `react to changes in data`.
React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
The name `React` was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
`React` is a `JavaScript-based UI development library`. `Facebook` and an `open-source developer community` run it.

## Q:5 What is `crossorigin in script tag`?

A: The `crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain. Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request. It is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```

## Q:6 What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?

A: `React` is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces whereas `ReactDOM` is also JavaScript library that allows `React to interact with the DOM`.
The react package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The react-dom package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

## Q:7 What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via `CDN`?

A: `Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.
`Development build` is several times (maybe 3-5x) `slower` than the `production build`.

## Q:8 What is `async and defer`?

A: `Async` - The async attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed as soon` as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

`Defer` - The defer attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed after the page` has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The `defer attribute` tells the browser `not to wait for the script`. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.

### _Syntax_

```sh
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```

Unless you're supporting ancient legacy systems, always add `type="module"` to all your script tags:

```sh
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script> and place the tag inside <head>
```

```sh
 <script defer nomodule> can be used as a legacy fallback.
```

As the name suggests, it allows you to import `modules`, which makes it easier to organize your code.
Enable `strict mode` by default. This makes your code run faster, and reports more runtime errors instead of silently ignoring them.
Execute your code only after the DOM has `initialized`, which makes DOM manipulation easier. Thanks to this, you won't need to listen to load/readystatechange/DOMContentLoaded events.
Prevent top level variables from implicitly polluting the global namespace.
Allow you to use top-level await in supported engines.
Load and parse your code `asynchronously`, which improves load performance.
