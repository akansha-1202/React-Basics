1.npm ==> it install the package i.e., npm install <package Name>
2.package.json ==> it keeps the approx. version of dependencies. it keep the configuration of our NPM. We must push it on GitHub
3.Bundlers ==> parcel, vite , webpack
4.dependencies ==> we also use in production,  dev-dependencies ==> that we are used in development like parcel is dev-dependecy
5.tilde(~) ==>update major version of package
  caret(^) ==> update minor/patch version of package
6.package-lock.json ==> it keeps the exact version of dependencies and transitive dependencies. We must push it on github
7.transitive dependencies ==> dependencies of dependencies like parcel is a dependency but parcel is also have so much dependencies when we install dependency node modules comes with so much code i.e., it is so much
8.node-modules ==> it is database that contain the actual data of our dependencies that our project needs. We don't need to push it on GitHub so we put it inside .gitignore ==> /node_modules
9..gitignore
10. It is not necessary to send node_modules file to GitHub but the most important file is package.json bcz it contains the all details of dependencies that are used in project. So if it present , we can regenerate node_modules by just running command "npm install"

11. Igniting the App ==> npx parcel index.html
12. parcel will host our app on a server ==> localhost:1234
13. npx ==> it executes the package i.e., npx <packageName>
     npx parcel index.html(source file)
14. We install REACT & REACT-DOM because CDN is not good way to use them.
     npm i react react-dom

22. Tree Shaking Algorithm 

23. In package.json, "main":"App.js", this key is removed as it tells the entry point of project
24. "dist" folder : This folder contains the files build files for production when you run command "npx parcel build index.html". It contains main 3 files which are html, css, js.
